# Purpose

As a student from the arts and humanities, I joined this course to overcome my anxiety around code and to build confidence engaging with artificial intelligence (AI) from a critical and creative perspective. My main purpose is not to become a professional programmer, but rather to learn how to read, interpret, and explain existing Python code, particularly in the context of AI applications. I want to bridge the gap between technical systems and cultural understanding—making code more approachable and meaningful for non-technical audiences like myself. By engaging with tools such as GitHub, GitHub Codespaces, and Microsoft Copilot, I aim to explore how programming and machine learning can support storytelling, cultural research, and inclusive design practices. This course has encouraged me to think of code not just as a technical language, but as a medium of expression and critique.

# Goals
## My specific goals for this course are:

- **1. Understand the Basics of Programming**

Learn how to read and understand core Python concepts such as printing, variables, data types, functions, loops, and conditional statements using examples generated with AI assistance.

- **2. Develop Coding Confidence in a Jupyter Notebook**

Practice using GitHub Codespaces and Jupyter Notebooks to create annotated code cells and markdown explanations that reflect my learning journey.

- **3. Learn How to Work with Media as Data**

Explore how different forms of media (text, image, sound) can be represented and manipulated in Python code. This helps me understand how digital humanities projects can engage with AI.

- **4. Critically Reflect on Machine Learning Models**

Use an existing machine learning notebook to follow a real-world workflow and reflect on what it means to use machine learning in the arts. I will document what I learned and what concerns or opportunities I see in applying these tools.

- **5. Design a Creative Application Using a Large Language Model (LLM)**

Imagine and outline a concept for an AI-powered tool or experience that is useful for learners, artists, or cultural researchers. My design will highlight interaction design, value (e.g., inclusion or engagement), and reflect on its social or cultural implications.

- **6. Collaborate and Communicate Across Disciplines**

Work in a shared GitHub environment and use markdown to communicate ideas clearly. I want my work to be accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

# Content Overview

This repository contains my full coursework submission for *AI for the Arts and Humanities*. It is structured into three main Jupyter notebooks and one `README.md` file. Each component reflects a different phase of the course and demonstrates my engagement with programming, machine learning, and creative AI design from a humanities perspective.

- **1. `coding_exercises.ipynb` – Basic Python Programming and Reflection**

This notebook documents my learning process during Weeks 1 to 5. It includes:

1. A step-by-step walkthrough of foundational Python concepts including printing, variables, functions, loops, conditional statements, lists, dictionaries, and more.
2. Prompt-based learning using Microsoft Copilot to explore each concept in the context of the classic "Hello, World!" program.
3. Markdown cells to explain the code in plain English and reflect on what I learned from each example, including Copilot's suggestions and my own understanding.
4. Explorations of how to process and display different types of media such as text, images, and audio using Python libraries like `IPython.display`, `PIL`, and `librosa`.
5. A summary of my key learning outcomes and a critical evaluation of Copilot as a tool for learning programming.

- **2. `Creative-LLM-Design.ipynb` – Conceptual Design of a Large Language Model Application**

This notebook presents my design proposal for a creative application that uses a large language model (LLM). The notebook includes:

1. A description of the context, purpose, and audience for my proposed application.
2. A detailed interaction design outlining how users would engage with the LLM, and how the system would support human creativity or learning.
3. A justification of how the design promotes one or more values: engagement, inclusion, or learning.
4. A critical reflection on the potential social and cultural implications of the design, including issues of representation, accessibility, and ethical considerations.
5. References to course readings, case studies, and examples of existing AI applications that inspired my concept.

- **3. `Machine-Learning-by-Example-from-Start-to-End.ipynb` – Applied Machine Learning**

This notebook was provided as a template and contains a complete machine learning workflow, which I followed and annotated. My contributions include:

1. Running all code cells and ensuring I understood each step, from data loading to training, testing, and evaluating a model.
2. Reflective markdown responses to questions embedded in the notebook, connecting technical steps to concepts from course lectures and readings.
3. A critical perspective on how machine learning models work, what assumptions they rely on, and how these models might be limited when applied to cultural and social contexts.
4. Peer-based reflections comparing my understanding and interpretations with those of others in the class.

- **4. `README.md` – Repository Introduction**

This file provides an accessible overview of the entire repository. It includes:

1. A statement of purpose explaining why I took this course and what I hoped to achieve.
2. A list of learning goals guiding my participation and progression.
3. A detailed summary of each notebook and its role in the overall portfolio.
4. Instructions for navigating the repository and understanding the structure of the submission.
