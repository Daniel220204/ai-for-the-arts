# AI for the Arts and Humanities Portfolio

The repository is designed to assist me in completing my lab work. And my goal is to understand Python and master it.

## Goals
- Learn GitHub basics and version control.
- Develop AI-driven tools for artistic and humanities-focused applications.
- Collaborate on interdisciplinary projects combining technology and the arts.
- Share insights, code, and resources with the broader community.
